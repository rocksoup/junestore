# Session Close

Automates the session close checklist from CLAUDE.md to ensure work is properly saved and pushed.

## Usage

Execute the session close script:

```bash
./.claude/skills/session-close/session-close.sh
```

The script will:
1. Show git status (what changed during session)
2. Stage code changes (interactive confirmation)
3. Sync beads issues to git
4. Commit code changes (prompts for commit message)
5. Sync beads again (capture any changes from commit hooks)
6. Push to git remote
7. **Optional:** Prompt to deploy to Shopify live

## Session Close Protocol

This skill implements the critical session close checklist from CLAUDE.md:

```
[ ] 1. git status              (check what changed)
[ ] 2. git add <files>         (stage code changes)
[ ] 3. bd sync                 (commit beads changes)
[ ] 4. git commit -m "..."     (commit code)
[ ] 5. bd sync                 (commit any new beads changes)
[ ] 6. git push                (push to remote)
```

**NEVER skip this protocol.** Work is not done until pushed.

## When to Use This Skill

Run `/session-close` when:
- You're ending a work session
- You've completed a feature or bug fix
- You're switching to a different task
- Claude Code is about to compact the conversation

Do NOT use this skill if:
- You have no changes to commit (just exit the session)
- You're in the middle of debugging (finish debugging first)
- Tests are failing (fix tests first)

## Deployment Option

At the end of the session close protocol, the script will ask:

```
Deploy to Shopify now? (y/n)
```

- **Yes:** Calls `/deploy-to-shopify` skill to deploy changes to live theme
- **No:** Skips deployment (you can run `/deploy-to-shopify` manually later)

Deployment is optional because:
- You might want to test locally first
- You might be deploying multiple commits at once
- You might want Jared to review changes before they go live

## Error Handling

**If git status shows no changes:**
- Script will inform you and exit
- No action needed

**If bd sync fails:**
- Script will exit with error
- Check beads status: `bd stats`
- Report issue to Jared

**If git push fails:**
- Script will exit with error
- Likely cause: remote has changes you don't have
- Run: `git pull --rebase` then retry

**If deployment is requested:**
- The `/deploy-to-shopify` skill will run
- See that skill's documentation for deployment-specific errors

## Reporting to Jared

After successful session close, report:
- What files were changed (from git status)
- Commit message used
- Whether beads were synced
- Whether deployment was performed
- Any errors encountered

## Notes

- This skill enforces the session close protocol
- Running this at the end of every session ensures no work is lost
- The optional deployment step provides a convenient path to make changes live
- If you're unsure whether to deploy, choose "no" and ask Jared

## Codex Compatibility (TODO)

**Current State:** This skill works with Claude Code only (`.claude/skills/` directory).

**Future Requirement:** This workflow needs to be adapted for Codex skills to ensure all AI agents working on this project can use the session close protocol.

**What needs to be done:**
1. Create Codex-compatible skill version in `skills/` directory
2. Ensure the core script (`.claude/skills/session-close/session-close.sh`) remains the shared implementation
3. Test that both Claude Code and Codex can execute the workflow
4. Update documentation to reflect both skill systems

**Why this matters:** Multiple AI agents from different companies may work on this codebase. The session close protocol must be accessible to all agents regardless of their platform.
