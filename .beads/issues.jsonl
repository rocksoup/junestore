{"id":"junestore-5tw","title":"Reduce Navbar Height - Logo Optimization Options","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current navbar is too tall (240px initial height) due to the logo dimensions and top margin. The animated logo (200×200px + 40px margin) creates excessive vertical space, and when scaled down, the text inside the logo (\"JUNE LINGERIE\" and \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\") becomes too small to read comfortably.\n\n### Current Dimensions\n- **Initial**: 200×200px, margin-top: 40px = **240px total**\n- **Scrolled**: 160×120px\n- **Mobile**: 100×100px, margin-top: 10px = **110px total**\n\n### Logo Structure\nThe logo contains:\n- **Emblem**: Circular border with heart symbol  \n- **Wordmark**: \"JUNE LINGERIE\" (64px serif) + \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\" (26px sans)\n\n**Challenge**: Text legibility at smaller sizes\n\n---\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option 1: Simple Size Reduction ⚡️\n\n**Approach**: Proportionally scale down the entire logo while maintaining current animation behavior.\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: 140×140px, margin-top: 20px = **160px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: 100×80px  \n- **Mobile**: 80×80px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Implementation** ( lines 164-238):\n```css\n/* Desktop - Initial */\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 140px;\n  height: 140px;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Scrolled */\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 80px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Wordmark Transform */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: translateY(-70px) scale(2.2);\n}\n\n/* Mobile - Initial */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 80px;\n    height: 80px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n  \n  .scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 70px;\n    height: 50px;\n  }\n  \n  .scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n    transform: translateY(-45px) scale(1.8);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Simplest implementation - CSS-only changes\n- Maintains all existing animations (emblem fade, wordmark zoom)\n- ~33% height reduction (240px → 160px)\n- Quick to test and iterate\n\n**Cons**:\n- Text in wordmark will be very small (64px → ~45px for \"JUNE LINGERIE\", 26px → ~18px for tagline)\n- May fail WCAG text size guidelines\n- Details in heart emblem may become unclear\n\n**Text Legibility Concerns**:\nAt 140px container, \"JUNE LINGERIE\" renders at ~45px (acceptable) but \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\" at ~18px (borderline illegible). This could hurt brand perception.\n\n---\n\n### Option 4: Landscape Orientation Hybrid 🌟 (RECOMMENDED)\n\n**Approach**: Switch from square to landscape (wider/shorter) while keeping emblem + wordmark horizontally arranged. This preserves visual impact while significantly reducing vertical space.\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: 220×120px (landscape), margin-top: 10px = **130px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: 160×70px\n- **Mobile**: 140×80px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Required Changes**:\n\n1. **SVG Modification** ():\n   - Change viewBox from  →  (landscape)\n   - Re-position emblem to left side (x: 250, y: 350)\n   - Re-position wordmark to right side (x: 750)\n   - Adjust circle radii to fit new viewBox proportions\n   - Scale heart path to maintain aspect ratio\n\n2. **CSS Updates** ():\n```css\n/* Desktop - Initial */\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 220px;\n  height: 120px;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Scrolled (only hide emblem, shrink container) */\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 160px;\n  height: 70px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Keep emblem fade on scroll */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-emblem {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.85);\n}\n\n/* Wordmark stays in place (no dramatic zoom) */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: translateX(-30px) scale(1.1); /* Shift left to fill emblem space */\n}\n\n/* Mobile - Stack vertically OR use emblem-only */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 140px;\n    height: 80px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n  \n  /* Option A: Hide wordmark, show emblem only */\n  .logo-wordmark { display: none; }\n  \n  /* OR Option B: Stack vertically (revert to portrait) */\n  /* SVG viewBox changes to 700×1000 on mobile via media query */\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- **46% height reduction** (240px → 130px) - most aggressive space savings\n- Text remains full-size and readable (no scaling required)\n- Emblem + wordmark side-by-side feels premium and balanced\n- Modern, editorial aesthetic (like Vogue, Net-a-Porter headers)\n- Animation becomes more subtle/sophisticated (less \"gimmicky\" zoom)\n\n**Cons**:\n- Requires SVG re-authoring (viewBox + element repositioning)\n- More complex implementation (~2-3 hours vs 30 min for Option 1)\n- Need to decide mobile behavior (emblem-only vs stacked)\n- May need design iteration to perfect horizontal layout\n\n**Mobile Strategy**:\n- **Recommended**: Switch to **emblem-only** (just circle + heart, hide text)\n- Alternative: Revert to vertical stack via responsive SVG viewBox\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Wordmark-Only (Text-Based Logo) 💭\n\n**Approach**: Completely remove the emblem (circle + heart) and use only the text \"JUNE LINGERIE\" as the logo. This is common for high-fashion brands (e.g., Chanel, Hermès).\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: Auto-width × 60px, margin-top: 10px = **70px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: Auto-width × 45px\n- **Mobile**: Auto-width × 50px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n1. **SVG Modification** ():\n```liquid\n\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" aria-label=\"June Lingerie\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 100\"\u003e\n  \u003ctext \n    x=\"400\" \n    y=\"70\" \n    class=\"logo-wordmark logo-fill-main\" \n    font-family=\"'Fraunces', 'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif\" \n    font-size=\"60\" \n    font-weight=\"600\" \n    letter-spacing=\"8\" \n    text-anchor=\"middle\"\n  \u003e\n    JUNE LINGERIE\n  \u003c/text\u003e\n  \u003c- Ensures Cream background (#F7F2ED) and Fraunces serif headings apply Optional: Add subtle underline or flourish --\u003e\n  \u003cline x1=\"200\" y1=\"85\" x2=\"600\" y2=\"85\" class=\"logo-stroke-main\" stroke-width=\"2\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\n```\n\n2. **CSS Updates** ():\n```css\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: auto;\n  height: 60px;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n  padding: 0 20px; /* Breathing room */\n}\n\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  height: 45px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Simple scale animation on scroll */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: scale(0.9);\n}\n\n/* Hover: Subtle color shift */\n.header__heading-link:hover .logo-wordmark {\n  fill: rgb(var(--color-accent)); /* Rose Coral */\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    height: 50px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- **71% height reduction** (240px → 70px) - most compact option\n- Immediately readable at any size\n- Clean, minimalist, high-fashion aesthetic\n- Simplifies animation logic (no emblem fade)\n- Best performance (smallest SVG payload)\n\n**Cons**:\n- **Loses brand equity** - the heart emblem is distinctive\n- Less playful/memorable compared to icon+text\n- Generic wordmark may not stand out in competitive market\n- Reduces visual interest on homepage hero\n\n**When to Use**:\n- If brand recognition is already established\n- If prioritizing extreme minimalism\n- As fallback for very small screens (mobile \u003c 375px)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation Priority\n\n1. **Option 4 (Landscape Hybrid)** - Best balance of impact + usability\n2. **Option 1 (Simple Reduction)** - Quick win if text legibility is acceptable\n3. **Option 3 (Wordmark-Only)** - Only if brand strategy shifts toward minimalism\n\n---\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\nAfter implementing chosen option:\n\n- [ ] Test on real devices (iPhone SE, iPad, MacBook)\n- [ ] Verify text legibility at arm's length (WCAG AAA: 18pt+ for body text)\n- [ ] Check animation smoothness (no jank on scroll)\n- [ ] Validate hover states (heart color change)\n- [ ] Ensure SVG scales correctly on ultra-wide monitors (2560px+)\n- [ ] Test with browser zoom at 150% and 200%\n- [ ] Validate against brand guidelines (if they exist)\n- [ ] Get stakeholder approval before pushing to live\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n-  (lines 164-238)\n-  (if Option 4 or 3)\n-  (no changes needed)\n\n## References\n\n- Current logo animation: Landing page inspiration (confirmed working)\n- Design system:  (Rose Coral: #E78C8C)\n- Typography: Fraunces (serif), Inter (sans-serif)\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rocksoup@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T07:26:39.663172-08:00","created_by":"Jared Stoneberg","updated_at":"2026-01-22T07:26:39.663172-08:00"}

{"id":"junestore-7di","title":"Reduce Navbar Height - Logo Optimization Options","description":"# Navbar Height Reduction - Logo Optimization Options\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current navbar is too tall (240px initial height) due to the logo dimensions and top margin. The animated logo (200×200px + 40px margin) creates excessive vertical space, and when scaled down, the text inside the logo (\"JUNE LINGERIE\" and \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\") becomes too small to read comfortably.\n\n### Current Dimensions\n- **Initial**: 200×200px, margin-top: 40px = **240px total**\n- **Scrolled**: 160×120px\n- **Mobile**: 100×100px, margin-top: 10px = **110px total**\n\n### Logo Structure\nThe logo contains:\n- **Emblem**: Circular border with heart symbol  \n- **Wordmark**: \"JUNE LINGERIE\" (64px serif) + \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\" (26px sans)\n\n**Challenge**: Text legibility at smaller sizes\n\n---\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option 1: Simple Size Reduction ⚡️\n\n**Approach**: Proportionally scale down the entire logo while maintaining current animation behavior.\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: 140×140px, margin-top: 20px = **160px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: 100×80px  \n- **Mobile**: 80×80px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Implementation** (`june-custom.css` lines 164-238):\n```css\n/* Desktop - Initial */\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 140px;\n  height: 140px;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Scrolled */\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 80px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Wordmark Transform */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: translateY(-70px) scale(2.2);\n}\n\n/* Mobile - Initial */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 80px;\n    height: 80px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n  \n  .scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 70px;\n    height: 50px;\n  }\n  \n  .scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n    transform: translateY(-45px) scale(1.8);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Simplest implementation - CSS-only changes\n- Maintains all existing animations (emblem fade, wordmark zoom)\n- ~33% height reduction (240px → 160px)\n- Quick to test and iterate\n\n**Cons**:\n- Text in wordmark will be very small (64px → ~45px for \"JUNE LINGERIE\", 26px → ~18px for tagline)\n- May fail WCAG text size guidelines\n- Details in heart emblem may become unclear\n\n**Text Legibility Concerns**:\nAt 140px container, \"JUNE LINGERIE\" renders at ~45px (acceptable) but \"PLAYFUL \u0026 PRETTY\" at ~18px (borderline illegible). This could hurt brand perception.\n\n---\n\n### Option 4: Landscape Orientation Hybrid 🌟 (RECOMMENDED)\n\n**Approach**: Switch from square to landscape (wider/shorter) while keeping emblem + wordmark horizontally arranged. This preserves visual impact while significantly reducing vertical space.\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: 220×120px (landscape), margin-top: 10px = **130px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: 160×70px\n- **Mobile**: 140×80px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Required Changes**:\n\n1. **SVG Modification** (`snippets/icon-june-logo.liquid`):\n   - Change viewBox from `\"0 0 1000 1000\"` → `\"0 0 1200 700\"` (landscape)\n   - Re-position emblem to left side (x: 250, y: 350)\n   - Re-position wordmark to right side (x: 750)\n   - Adjust circle radii to fit new viewBox proportions\n   - Scale heart path to maintain aspect ratio\n\n2. **CSS Updates** (`june-custom.css`):\n```css\n/* Desktop - Initial */\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 220px;\n  height: 120px;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n}\n\n/* Desktop - Scrolled (only hide emblem, shrink container) */\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: 160px;\n  height: 70px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Keep emblem fade on scroll */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-emblem {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.85);\n}\n\n/* Wordmark stays in place (no dramatic zoom) */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: translateX(-30px) scale(1.1); /* Shift left to fill emblem space */\n}\n\n/* Mobile - Stack vertically OR use emblem-only */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    width: 140px;\n    height: 80px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n  \n  /* Option A: Hide wordmark, show emblem only */\n  .logo-wordmark { display: none; }\n  \n  /* OR Option B: Stack vertically (revert to portrait) */\n  /* SVG viewBox changes to 700×1000 on mobile via media query */\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- **46% height reduction** (240px → 130px) - most aggressive space savings\n- Text remains full-size and readable (no scaling required)\n- Emblem + wordmark side-by-side feels premium and balanced\n- Modern, editorial aesthetic (like Vogue, Net-a-Porter headers)\n- Animation becomes more subtle/sophisticated (less \"gimmicky\" zoom)\n\n**Cons**:\n- Requires SVG re-authoring (viewBox + element repositioning)\n- More complex implementation (~2-3 hours vs 30 min for Option 1)\n- Need to decide mobile behavior (emblem-only vs stacked)\n- May need design iteration to perfect horizontal layout\n\n**Mobile Strategy**:\n- **Recommended**: Switch to **emblem-only** (just circle + heart, hide text)\n- Alternative: Revert to vertical stack via responsive SVG viewBox\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Wordmark-Only (Text-Based Logo) 💭\n\n**Approach**: Completely remove the emblem (circle + heart) and use only the text \"JUNE LINGERIE\" as the logo. This is common for high-fashion brands (e.g., Chanel, Hermès).\n\n**Proposed Dimensions**:\n- **Initial**: Auto-width × 60px, margin-top: 10px = **70px total** (vs 240px)\n- **Scrolled**: Auto-width × 45px\n- **Mobile**: Auto-width × 50px, margin-top: 5px\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n1. **SVG Modification** (`snippets/icon-june-logo.liquid`):\n```liquid\n\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" aria-label=\"June Lingerie\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 100\"\u003e\n  \u003ctext \n    x=\"400\" \n    y=\"70\" \n    class=\"logo-wordmark logo-fill-main\" \n    font-family=\"'Fraunces', 'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif\" \n    font-size=\"60\" \n    font-weight=\"600\" \n    letter-spacing=\"8\" \n    text-anchor=\"middle\"\n  \u003e\n    JUNE LINGERIE\n  \u003c/text\u003e\n  \u003c!-- Optional: Add subtle underline or flourish --\u003e\n  \u003cline x1=\"200\" y1=\"85\" x2=\"600\" y2=\"85\" class=\"logo-stroke-main\" stroke-width=\"2\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\n```\n\n2. **CSS Updates** (`june-custom.css`):\n```css\n.header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  width: auto;\n  height: 60px;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n  padding: 0 20px; /* Breathing room */\n}\n\n.scrolled-past-header .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n  height: 45px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* Simple scale animation on scroll */\n.scrolled-past-header .logo-wordmark {\n  transform: scale(0.9);\n}\n\n/* Hover: Subtle color shift */\n.header__heading-link:hover .logo-wordmark {\n  fill: rgb(var(--color-accent)); /* Rose Coral */\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .header__heading-logo-wrapper.custom-logo {\n    height: 50px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- **71% height reduction** (240px → 70px) - most compact option\n- Immediately readable at any size\n- Clean, minimalist, high-fashion aesthetic\n- Simplifies animation logic (no emblem fade)\n- Best performance (smallest SVG payload)\n\n**Cons**:\n- **Loses brand equity** - the heart emblem is distinctive\n- Less playful/memorable compared to icon+text\n- Generic wordmark may not stand out in competitive market\n- Reduces visual interest on homepage hero\n\n**When to Use**:\n- If brand recognition is already established\n- If prioritizing extreme minimalism\n- As fallback for very small screens (mobile \u003c 375px)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation Priority\n\n1. **Option 4 (Landscape Hybrid)** - Best balance of impact + usability\n2. **Option 1 (Simple Reduction)** - Quick win if text legibility is acceptable\n3. **Option 3 (Wordmark-Only)** - Only if brand strategy shifts toward minimalism\n\n---\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\nAfter implementing chosen option:\n\n- [ ] Test on real devices (iPhone SE, iPad, MacBook)\n- [ ] Verify text legibility at arm's length (WCAG AAA: 18pt+ for body text)\n- [ ] Check animation smoothness (no jank on scroll)\n- [ ] Validate hover states (heart color change)\n- [ ] Ensure SVG scales correctly on ultra-wide monitors (2560px+)\n- [ ] Test with browser zoom at 150% and 200%\n- [ ] Validate against brand guidelines (if they exist)\n- [ ] Get stakeholder approval before pushing to live\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `assets/june-custom.css` (lines 164-238)\n- `snippets/icon-june-logo.liquid` (if Option 4 or 3)\n- `sections/header.liquid` (no changes needed)\n\n## References\n\n- Current logo animation: Landing page inspiration (confirmed working)\n- Design system: `/config/settings_data.json` (Rose Coral: #E78C8C)\n- Typography: Fraunces (serif), Inter (sans-serif)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rocksoup@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T07:31:00.512276-08:00","created_by":"Jared Stoneberg","updated_at":"2026-01-22T07:57:40.583683-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-22T07:57:40.583683-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Many merchants are auto-opted in as of Jan 12, 2026. This is critical for discovery in the 'webless web' where customers shop via AI agents.\n\n## Key Tasks\n\n### 1. Enable Agentic Storefront Channel\n- Access Shopify Admin and enable agentic storefront sales channel\n- Check if store is auto-opted in or on waitlist\n- Toggle which AI platforms to enable (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot)\n\n### 2.

Set Up Knowledge Base App\nUpload comprehensive brand information:\n- Product FAQs\n- Return policies and procedures\n- Brand voice guidelines\n- Sizing information specific to lingerie\n\n### 4. Checkout Experience Optimization\n- Review checkout branding (AI partners may override custom UI)\n- Document any upsells/post-purchase flows that may not appear in AI checkouts\n- Test checkout flow in available AI platforms\n- Ensure checkout complies with Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)\n\n### 5.

{"id":"junestore-dxk","title":"Product Page Enhancements","description":"Enhance product pages to maximize conversion, build customer confidence, and showcase products effectively.\n\n## Overview\nProduct pages are decision-making engines where persuasion, reassurance, information, and brand identity converge. In 2026, 56% of users explore product images as their first action. Fashion apparel market projected to reach $416.5B in the US by 2026.\n\n## Key Performance Drivers\n- **Visual quality**: High-resolution images, multiple angles, zoom functionality\n- **Information completeness**: Size guides, fabric details, care instructions, fit information\n- **Social proof**: Reviews, ratings, user-generated content\n- **Trust signals**: Clear returns policy, secure checkout, brand authenticity\n- **Mobile optimization**: 70%+ of traffic is mobile-first\n\n## Core Enhancement Areas\n\n### 1.

Size and Fit Information\n**Best Practice**: Display size/fit guidance prominently\n- Size selector with adjacent \"Size Guide\" link\n- Model measurements and size worn\n- Fit feedback from reviews (\"runs small/large/true to size\")\n- Visual size comparison or measurement diagram\n- International size conversions\n- Fit recommendations based on past purchases (if available)\n\n### 4. Product Descriptions and Copywriting\n**Structure**:\n- **Headline**: Key benefit or unique selling proposition\n- **Short description**: 2-3 sentences summarizing style, fit, occasion\n- **Feature bullets**: 4-6 key features with benefits\n- **Full description**: Expandable section with fabric details, care, styling tips\n- **Technical specs**: Dimensions, weight, materials, country of origin\n\n**Copywriting Best Practices**:\n- Focus on benefits, not just features\n- Use sensory language for fabric (soft, smooth, breathable)\n- Address customer questions preemptively\n- Include use cases and occasions\n- Brand voice consistency\n\n### 5. Social Proof and Reviews\n**Implementation**:\n- Star rating visible in product grid and page header\n- Review count with link to reviews section\n- Recent reviews displayed prominently\n- Filter reviews by rating, fit, verified purchase\n- User-generated photos from reviews\n- Q\u0026A section for product questions\n\n**Review Optimization**:\n- Request reviews post-purchase (automated emails)\n- Incentivize reviews (loyalty points, discount codes)\n- Respond to negative reviews professionally\n- Highlight helpful reviews\n\n### 6. Cross-Selling and Related Products\n**Strategic Placement**:\n- \"Complete the Set\" - matching bra/panty sets\n- \"You May Also Like\" - similar styles or colors\n- \"Customers Also Bought\" - data-driven recommendations\n- \"Recently Viewed\" - personalization\n- Bundle offers with discount incentive\n\n**Best Practices**:\n- Show 4-6 related products maximum\n- Use product thumbnails with price\n- Place below fold but above reviews\n- Test different algorithms (similar vs complementary)\n\n### 7.
