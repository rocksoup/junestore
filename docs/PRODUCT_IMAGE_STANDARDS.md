# Product Image Standards

Use this checklist when uploading product media in Shopify. The goal is consistent, high-quality imagery that supports zoom and mobile viewing.

## Capture Requirements
- 8+ images per product
- Resolution: 2000-3000px on the long edge
- Color space: sRGB
- Orientation: portrait (3:4 or 4:5) preferred for apparel

## Shot Checklist
- Front (full)
- Back (full)
- Side (full)
- 45-degree angle
- Detail close-up (fabric/trim)
- Detail close-up (construction/fit)
- On-model (full)
- Flat lay or packaging detail

## File Prep
- Format: JPEG or PNG upload (Shopify CDN serves WebP/AVIF to supported browsers)
- Max file size target: <2 MB each after export
- Background: clean, neutral, consistent lighting
- Naming: `product-handle_01_front.jpg`, `product-handle_02_back.jpg`, etc.
- Alt text: describe the view + product name (ex: "June Brief front view")

## Upload Location
Shopify Admin -> Products -> Media.

## Theme Notes
- The product gallery and modal support zoom on desktop and pinch-to-zoom on mobile.
- The theme now serves WebP via `<picture>` sources with fallbacks.
