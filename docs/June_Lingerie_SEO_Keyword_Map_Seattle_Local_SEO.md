*Prepared: 2026-01-20*

## Project context
- **Project:** June Lingerie (Seattle-designed and manufactured underwear brand)
- **Products:** **Briefs / panties only** (both **mid-rise** and **high-rise**)
- **Audience:** Women **28–50**
- **Market:** United States (launch) + **strong Seattle local presence**
- **Tone:** Pretty + playful
- **Competitors to benchmark:** Negative Underwear, Natori
- **Site sections:** Shopify store + **Blog** (existing) + **FAQ** (needed)

---

## ASSUMPTIONS
- Price point is **mid-premium** (in the competitive neighborhood of Negative/Natori).
- Materials/claims (organic, sustainable, etc.) are **only used** if verified by product specs.
- You do **not** have a customer-facing public location **yet**; local SEO plan includes a “pre-location” phase.
- Current catalog is small (limited SKUs), so we prioritize **collection-level** and **style/fit** landing pages over deep PLP proliferation.

## SEATTLE LOCAL SEO PLAN

### Phase 1 — Before you have a public location
Goal: win **organic local intent** (“Seattle lingerie”, “Seattle made underwear”) and build prominence signals.

**Do now**
1. Publish **/seattle-lingerie**  
   - H1: “Seattle lingerie & underwear — designed and made in Seattle”  
   - Include: brand story, production proof, Seattle photography, “online nationwide” clarity, email signup for local popups.
2. Publish **/made-in-seattle** (process + proof page)  
   - Include: studio/process photos, materials, why Seattle, quality controls.
3. Add sitewide microcopy: “Designed & made in Seattle, WA” in footer + About + collection intros.
4. Build local prominence signals:
   - Seattle press/features, partner links, event/popup listings, local directories (legit ones), collaborations.

**Avoid**
- Don’t create a location-based Google Business Profile until you have a setup that matches reality.

### Phase 2 — Once you have a legitimate public location or by-appointment setup
Goal: win the local pack + map discovery.

**Do immediately**
- Create/verify Google Business Profile with correct category, hours, photos.
- Keep NAP consistent across site and citations.
- Add LocalBusiness schema on your location page with accurate details.

---

## OPPORTUNITY NOTES
- Best near-term wedge: **women’s briefs** + **high waisted underwear** + **mid rise underwear** (style-intent, less brutal than head terms).
- Seattle pages can rank organically even pre-location: relevance + local links + proof.
- Small catalog advantage: tight IA + internal links + very specific copy.

---

## CONTENT GAPS (priority order)
1. **/faq** — sizing, returns, shipping, care, “where made”, “how it fits”
2. **/size-guide** — measurement guide + fit notes by rise (mid vs high)
3. **/made-in-seattle** — proof and story
4. **/seattle-lingerie** — local intent landing page
5. Blog starters:
   - High-rise vs mid-rise briefs: which is best?
   - How to measure hips for underwear sizing
   - How to wash lingerie so it lasts
   - What makes underwear comfortable?

---

## INTERNAL LINKING IDEAS
- Footer (sitewide): Underwear, Briefs, High-rise, Mid-rise, Size Guide, FAQ, Made in Seattle, Seattle.
- PDP: “Fit & Sizing” module → /size-guide + FAQ anchors
- Blog: always link to the relevant collection + /size-guide
